# Quantum Walks Monte Carlo (WISER)

This project is inspired by the research and educational content from [WISER - Quantum Walks Monte Carlo](https://www.thewiser.org/quantum-walks-monte-carlo).

## Overview
This repository contains resources, code, and notes related to quantum walks and their application to Monte Carlo methods, as explored in the WISER program.

## Content 
- TASK - 1: Reviewed the paper and the related resources to learn how to implement quantum Galton boards. Prepared a summary of understanding in a well-structured 2-pager document.
- TASK - 2: Using the 1- and 2-layer Galton Box code as a starting point, write a general algorithm that generates a circuit for any number of layers to output a Gaussian distribution.
             SDK used -- Qiksit (1.4.2)
- TASK - 3: Modified the function so that it obtains a different target distribution. Used a noiseless all-to-all sampler:
             Exponential distribution
